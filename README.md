# reproduce_plot: A python wrapper for reproducible visualization

## Objective
* Enables reproduction and modification (colorscheme, caption, layout, ...) of figures at lower level by just wrapping the plotting function with a wrapper function `img_save`. The wrapper saves the arguments as one `pickle` file per figure.
* Convenient for scientific visualizations, especially for those expect revisions in review processes.

## Usage
See `sample.py`
